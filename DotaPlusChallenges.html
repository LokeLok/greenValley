            <h1>Hero Challenges a Never Ending Story</h1>
            <br>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <hr class="green">
            <p>Dota 2 is an ever evolving game and the game has changed a lot since Hero Leveling was introduced with Dota Plus back in March of 2018. Since then there hasn't been many changes to how this system work, with a couple of exceptions. 
                We've gotten Grandmaster Tier as maximum level and Hero Relics gives a small amount of experience towards Hero Leveling. Other than that not much has change and that's alright since it's a good system. The current 
                system has one big flaw; Hero Challenges. There are way too many unreasonable Challenges, which has never been addressed by the Dota devs. !!!Challenges that affects enemy Heres should show number going up if enemy is in FoW</p>
            <br>
            <p>This is a final plea to the devs to cleanup and fix every single Hero Challenge. Hero Challenges should be <u><i><b>REASONABLE & WORK</b></i></u>.</p>
            <p>It's time to let go of certain types of Challenges, cleanup the rest. Give them all the same formatting keeping it short, simple, concise and consistent.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Check out the current Challenge and its flaws <a href="CurrentChallenges.html">here</a>. Challenges that should be removed can be found <a href="RemovedChallenges.html">here</a>. All the new suggestions are over <a href="NewChallenges.html">here</a>. 
                And lastly <a href="OtherBugs.html">here</a> are some UI isssues connected with Hero Challenges.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>Challenges Interfering with Gameplay</h3>
            <hr class="green">
            <p>Challenges should never influence players decision making. Therefore any Challenges that reqiures item's, facet's, talent tree's, game time, ability combo's or enemy depended should be removed.</p>
            <p>When it comes to these types of Challenges, it's time to stop with hit 3+ 4+ enemy Heroes with an ability.</p>
            <p>Challenges that you need to use abilities in a combo should be removed. why? They need to be done in a specific order, which interfere with gameplay.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>Outdated Challenges</h3>
            <hr class="green">
            <p>This will always be an issue, but by removing, simplify and standardize Challenges, it will become easier for the community to give feedback on what's wrong.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Examples of Challenges being outdated</p>
            <div class="hero-list">
                <ul>
                    <li>Deal <span>3000</span> / <span>6000</span> / <span>9000</span> damage to enemy Heroes with <span>Searing Arrows</span>.</li>

            <h3>Unattainable Challenges</h3>
            <hr class="green">
            <p>There are many Challenges that are unattainable beacuse of the numbers are unreasonable. I don't think this is a job for the community to keep track of and give feedback, since we've no way to sandbox test this ourselves. 
                Dota devs are the ones that can track each Challenge and their completion rate. Gather data and adjust the numbers accordingly and tune them to match an average Dota game. Three star Challenges 
                should be the most likely outcome in an average Dota game.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>Template Used for Writing Hero Specific Challenges</h3>
            <hr class="green">
            <p>I've used already exsisting formatting from the devs and applied the best and shortes way to explain a Challenge. I've tweak a few to match up with the rest. This is my personally recommendation based on how the Challenges are 
                currently written, together with the most common Dota terms. If you think there is a better way to write some of them, please keep it short, concise and the same across all Heroes.
