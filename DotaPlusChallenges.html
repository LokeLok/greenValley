            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <hr class="green">
            <p>Dota 2 is an ever evolving game and the game has changed a lot since Hero Leveling was introduced with Dota Plus back in March of 2018. Since then there hasn't been many changes to how this system work, with a couple of exceptions. 
                We've gotten Grandmaster Tier as maximum level and Hero Relics gives a small amount of experience towards Hero Leveling. Other than that not much has change and that's alright since it's a good system. The biggest issue I've with this 
                system, is the Hero Challenges. I know it's a big ask to change as much as I've presented here, but hopfully you can see the same issues as I do and make a change for the better.</p>

            <hr class="green">
            <p>Please consider gathering data about completion rate of each challenge and adjust the scaling accordingly.</p>

            <h3>Template Used for Writing Hero Specific Challenges</h3>
            <hr class="green">
            <p>I've used already exsisting formatting from the game and applied the shortes and most precise way to explain a challenge. I've tweaked a few to match up with the rest. This is my personal recommendation based on how the challenges are 
                currently written, together with the most common Dota terms. If you think there is a better way to write some of them, please keep it short, concise and the same across all Heroes.
