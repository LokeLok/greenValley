            <h1>Everything Wrong Hero Challenges</h1>
            <br>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Dota 2 is an ever evolving game and a lot has change since Hero Leveling was introduced with Dota Plus back in March of 2018. Since then there hasn't been many changes to how this system work, with the exceptions of two things. We've gone from Master Tier(level 25) 
               being the max, to Grandmaster(level 30) and Relics gives a small amount of experience towards Hero Leveling. Other than that, not much has change and that's alright, since it's a fairly good system.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Hero Challenges being the main part of gaing experience has been a good thing. There is just one big flaw, they SUCK.</p>
            <br>
            <p> A lot of Challenges has been <a href="RemoveChallenges.html">removed</a>, but many times more <a href="NewChallenges.html">new</a> have been suggested.</p>
            <br>
            <p></p>
            <br>
            <p>There are also some other minor <a href="OtherBugs.html">UI issues</a> connected with Hero Challenges.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Challenges Interfering with Gameplay</h3>
            <p>Challenges should never influence players decision making. Therefore any Challenges that reqiures Item's, Facet's, Talent Tree's, Game Time or the enemies for you to complete Challenges, should be removed. If you really want to keep item Challenges let players selecet which item Challenge to chose. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Bugged Challenges</h3>
            <p>Common bugs: not working, partially working, description and function have different outcome.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Examples of Challenges that don't work.</p>
            <div class="hero-list">
                <ul>
                    <li>Deal <span>2500</span> / <span>5000</span> / <span>7500</span> damage to enemy Heroes with <span>Marksmanship</span>. | Has never worked</li>
                    <li>Deal <span>3000</span> / <span>5000</span> / <span>7000</span> damage to enemy Buildings with <span>Spirit Bear</span>. | Stopped working after Spirit Bear became Universial</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>Exampals of Challenges that partially work</p>
            <div class="hero-list">
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Multicast</span> enemy Heroes a total of <span>10</span> / <span>20</span> / <span>30</span> times. | Doesn't work with Fat Chance Facet</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>Examples of Challenges that work different from their description</p>
            <div class="hero-list">
                <ul>
                    <li>Deal <span>6000</span> / <span>12000</span> / <span>18000</span> damage to enemy Heroes with <span>Arc Lightning</span>. | Counts damage done to creeps(possible to any unit).</li>
                    <li>Kill <span>6</span> / <span>12</span> / <span>18</span> enemy Heroes that are slowed by <span>Reflection</span>. | Counts assists.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>It's important that the function of the Challenge works as described. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Combo Challenges</h3>
            <p>Challenges that has the requierment in them should be removed.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Outdated Challenges</h3>
            <p>This will always be an issue, but removing some Challenges and by standardize the rest. It will improve readablity, tracking bugs and mainting them after gameplay patches much easier.</p>
            <div class="hero-list">
                <ul>
                    <li>Deal <span>4000</span> / <span>8000</span> / <span>12000</span> damage to enemy Heroes with <span>Poison Nova</span> that is upgraded with Aghanim's Scepter.</li>
                    <li>Deal <span>3000</span> / <span>6000</span> / <span>9000</span> damage to enemy Heroes with <span>Searing Arrows</span>.</li>
                    <li>Deal <span>4000</span> / <span>8000</span> / <span>12000</span> damage to enemy Heroes with the <span>Second Chakram</span>.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <br>
            <h3>Unattainable Challenges</h3>
            <p>This is a major issues, the share amount of Challenges that are unattainable beacuse of the numbers are unreasonable is not ok. It's time for the dev team to start track every single Challenge completion and adjust the numbers deemed too high or low.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Description a Jungle of 10.000 Spiches</h3>
            <p>Challenges that wanna express the same thing, has so many different ways to do so. There are no reason for this.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Challenges that says 'to allied Heroes' should ALWAYS include yourself.</p>
            <br>
